COMMON FAQS
Q: How do I start building with this corpus?
A: Follow 3-phase plan in Master Plan (Weeks 1–40). Start with Phase 1 foundation, validate accuracy, then expand.

Q: Should I fine-tune or RAG?
A: Hybrid (80% RAG for regulations, 20% fine-tuning for synthesis). RAG ensures source attribution; fine-tuning enables natural explanations.

Q: What's the priority domain?
A: Start with institutional portfolio management (quant + risk), NOT personal finance. Enterprise AUM market is larger and higher-margin.

Q: What's realistic accuracy?
A: Tax (95%+), estate planning (90%+), credit risk (85%+), portfolio optimization (80–85%). All require human review for complex scenarios.

Q: Can I commercialize this?
A: Yes, with proper licensing, disclaimers, and compliance. Engage regulatory counsel (SEC, FINRA, state regulators). Maintain audit trails. Consider E&O insurance.

Q: How do I stay current?
A: Implement continuous monitoring: monthly (IRS/state updates), quarterly (tax law changes), annually (full curriculum refresh). Use feed subscriptions.

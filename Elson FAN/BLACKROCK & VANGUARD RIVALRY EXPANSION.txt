CRITICAL COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE
BlackRock's Aladdin Ecosystem

AUM Managed: $21.6 trillion | Clients: 500+ institutions | Revenue: $3.5B+ annually

Key Architecture:

Single platform: Portfolio construction → Risk analytics → Trading → Compliance → Operations

"Common Data Language" solves institutional data fragmentation

Labeled data factory: Decades of structured transaction data

500+ client base creates high switching costs

6,000 computers in Wenatchee, WA data center

Aladdin Core Functions:

Function	Capability
Portfolio Management	Construction, performance, attribution, scenario modeling
Risk Analytics	Market, liquidity, credit, regulatory risk + stress testing
Aladdin Climate	Advanced climate risk models and ESG integration

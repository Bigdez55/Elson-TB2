    "output": "The paper demonstrates that log-volatility behaves as fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H ≈ 0.1, much smaller than 0.5. This 'rough' behavior explains many empirical properties of volatility including the term structure of implied volatility, volatility persistence, and the leverage effect. The rough volatility framework provides a more accurate model than traditional stochastic volatility models.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "The Hurst parameter H characterizes the roughness of paths in fractional Brownian motion. In rough volatility models, H ≈ 0.1, indicating very rough (irregular) paths. When H = 0.5, we have standard Brownian motion. H < 0.5 indicates rougher-than-Brownian paths with antipersistent increments. The low Hurst parameter in volatility explains why realized volatility exhibits such erratic short-term behavior while still showing long-range dependence.",

    "output": "Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is a generalization of Brownian motion characterized by the Hurst parameter H. Unlike standard Brownian motion where increments are independent, fBm increments are correlated. For H < 0.5 (rough regime), past positive increments make future negative increments more likely, creating rough, irregular paths. In volatility modeling, log-volatility is modeled as fBm with H ≈ 0.1, explaining the fractal-like behavior of volatility time series.",

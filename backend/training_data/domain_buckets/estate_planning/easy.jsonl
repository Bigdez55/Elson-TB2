Some trust documents grant protectors even broader powers, such as decanting authority (transferring trust assets to new trusts with modified terms) or the power to appoint or remove successor protectors.[35][21]\n\nTrust protectors should be selected for financial acumen, objectivity, and independence from both the trustee and beneficiaries. Professionals often recommend attorneys, accountants, or experienced fiduciaries rather than family members, as independence is essential for the role to function effectively.

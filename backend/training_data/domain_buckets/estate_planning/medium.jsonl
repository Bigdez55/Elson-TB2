DoRA decomposes weights for better precision in symbolic finance rules (e.g., trust protector powers). Combine with Chain-of-Thought RAG: Retrieve chunks, then fine-tune on-the-fly via SensiLoRA-RAG  for specialized Q&A.\n- **Integration Points**: \n- Modify /backend/scripts/finetune_wealth_management.py: Swap WEALTH_MANAGEMENT_LORA_CONFIG for DoRA (use PEFT library: from peft import DoRALoraConfig).\n- Enhance WealthManagementRAG in knowledge_rag.py: Add CoT prompting pre-retrieval, injecting family context from schemas/wealth_advisory.py.\n- Update training data: Augment qa_pairs.jsonl with symbolic examples (e.g., \"Apply fiduciary duty: loyalty in trustee-beneficiary dispute\").\n- **Acceptance Tests**: \n- Benchmark latency/accuracy on 100 test queries (e.g., \"Optimize GST tax in cross-border trusts\"): Expect >90% BERTScore vs. baseline .\n- Script: python backend/tests/integration/test_wealth_integration.py --add-dora --compare-lora.", "category": "estate_planning", "source": "final_training_data", "hash": "713f8203fd7d", "difficulty": "medium", "task_type": "explanation", "risk_level": "high", "requires_tools": false, "requires_retrieval": true}

Agents handle roles dynamically: e.g., Monitor agent tracks query context (family governance), Analyze plans adaptations (e.g., switch modes for infinite banking), Plan executes via RAG/fine-tuned inference, Execute outputs with feedback. This enables proactive wealth scenarios, like auto-adjusting for regulatory changes in AML [web:27, web:32].\n- **Integration Points**:\n- New directory: /backend/app/services/mape_k_agents.py. Use LangChain/Agent0 for agents: Define MAPE-K loop (Monitor: real-time X/web_search for finance updates; Analyze/Plan: neuro-symbolic verifier for rules [web:16, web:18]).\n- Tie to API: In wealth_advisory.py, route queries through agents (e.g., SuccessionRequest invokes multi-agent orchestration).\n- Frontend: Enhance WealthAdvisoryChat.tsx with agent status (e.g., \"Analyzing tax implications...\").\n- **Acceptance Tests**:\n- Simulate adaptation: Inject mock regulatory change (e.g., GST tax update); expect auto-replan with 80%+ accuracy .\n- Script: pytest backend/tests/integration/test_mape_k.py --scenarios=generational_wealth.", "category": "estate_planning", "source": "final_training_data", "hash": "ff411a3747f1", "difficulty": "medium", "task_type": "explanation", "risk_level": "high", "requires_tools": true, "requires_retrieval": true}

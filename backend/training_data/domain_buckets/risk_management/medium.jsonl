This implies that volatility is far \"rougher\" and more jagged than the standard Brownian motion ($H=0.5$) assumed in classical models.33  \n- **Implication for ASI:** The ASI uses **Rough Fractional Stochastic Volatility (RFSV)** models for pricing and hedging. These models accurately reproduce the steep skew of the implied volatility surface for short-dated options, a feat that Heston models struggle with. This gives the ASI a distinct pricing advantage in the options market.35  \n- **Pricing Methods:** Since RFSV models are non-Markovian, standard PDE solvers don't work.

This moves beyond probabilistic testing to absolute certainty of code correctness.85  \n- **Symbolic Execution:** The ASI employs symbolic execution engines (like **Manticore** or **Mythril**) to explore every possible execution path of a smart contract, identifying vulnerabilities like integer overflows or logic errors before committing capital.87", "category": "risk_management", "source": "final_training_data", "hash": "8c1d792e74f5", "difficulty": "medium", "task_type": "general", "risk_level": "high", "requires_tools": false, "requires_retrieval": false}

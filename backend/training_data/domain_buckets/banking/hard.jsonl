The spread between these yields and the risk-free rate constitutes the credit risk premium.5  \n* **Securitized Products:** The process of securitization transforms illiquid assets into tradable securities.  \n  * **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS):** Pools of residential or commercial mortgages.  \n  * **Asset-Backed Securities (ABS):** Pools of auto loans, credit card receivables, or student loans.  \n  * **Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs):** Structured finance products that pool cash flow-generating assets and repackage this asset pool into discrete tranches that can be sold to investors.7", "category": "banking", "source": "final_training_data", "hash": "22e8504958bd", "difficulty": "hard", "task_type": "explanation", "risk_level": "high", "requires_tools": false, "requires_retrieval": false}

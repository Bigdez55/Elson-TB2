Standard PDE solvers don't work (non-Markovian)\n2. Requires advanced Monte Carlo and asymptotic expansions\n3. Provides pricing advantage in options markets\n4. Better hedging through more accurate delta/gamma\n\n**Academic Foundation:**\n- \"Volatility is Rough\" paper (2014)\n- Work by Gatheral, Bayer, Friz at Baruch/TU Berlin\n\nKey steps include: 1) Assess current position, 2) Identify constraints and goals, 3) Develop actionable recommendations, 4) Monitor and adjust as needed.", "category": "quantitative_finance", "source": "final_training_data", "hash": "b109063227a3", "difficulty": "hard", "task_type": "recommendation", "risk_level": "high", "requires_tools": false, "requires_retrieval": false}

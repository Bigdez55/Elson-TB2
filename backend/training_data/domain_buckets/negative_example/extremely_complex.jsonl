Issues: 1) High fees (often 50%+ of first year premiums go to commissions), 2) Low returns (2-4% typical), 3) Complexity, 4) Surrender penalties for years. Better approach: buy cheap term life if you have dependents, invest the difference in index funds. A 28-year-old's $500/month is better in a Roth IRA than whole life.\n\nKey steps include: 1) Assess current position, 2) Identify constraints and goals, 3) Develop actionable recommendations, 4) Monitor and adjust as needed.", "category": "negative_example", "source": "final_training_data", "hash": "bd99fddb13ca", "difficulty": "extremely_complex", "task_type": "general", "risk_level": "high", "requires_tools": false, "requires_retrieval": true}

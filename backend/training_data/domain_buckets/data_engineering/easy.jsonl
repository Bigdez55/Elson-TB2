Standard ML models often fail in finance because they learn spurious correlations that break down when market regimes change.\n\n* **Double Machine Learning (DML):** Based on the work of **Victor Chernozhukov**, DML allows the ASI to estimate the true causal effect of a treatment (e.g., a central bank rate hike) on an outcome (asset prices) in the presence of high-dimensional confounding variables. It uses a two-stage regression process to \"partial out\" the noise, providing unbiased estimators of causal parameters.59  \n* **Causal Discovery:** The ASI employs algorithms like the **PC Algorithm** or **FCI** to discover causal graphs from time-series data.

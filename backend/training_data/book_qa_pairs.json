Key tags include Tag 35 (MsgType, e.g., 'D' for New Order Single, '8' for Execution Report), Tag 38 (OrderQty), and Tag 44 (Price). Crucially, the ASI utilizes **Tag 847 (TargetStrategy)** and custom tags to instruct broker algorithms (e.g., VWAP, TWAP) when not executing directly.30  \n- **FIXML:** For post-trade clearing and settlement, the system supports FIXML, the XML representation of FIX messages, ensuring interoperability with modern clearing houses.32",

    "output": "****8.3 Risk Parity & Kelly Criterion****\n\n- * **Risk Parity:** The ASI constructs portfolios where each asset class contributes equally to the total portfolio risk (volatility), rather than capital. Mathematically, the weight $w\\_i$ of asset $i$ is proportional to the inverse of its volatility $\\\\sigma\\_i$ (i.e., $w\\_i \\\\propto 1/\\\\sigma\\_i$). This creates a balanced portfolio that performs well across different economic regimes (growth vs. inflation).72  \n- **Kelly Criterion:** For sizing high-conviction alpha bets, the ASI uses the Kelly Criterion ($f^\\* \\= \\\\mu / \\\\sigma^2$) to maximize the long-term geometric growth rate of capital. To prevent ruin due to parameter uncertainty (estimation error in $\\\\mu$ or $\\\\sigma$), the ASI implements \"Fractional Kelly\" (e.g., betting half the Kelly size).74",

Rather than managing discrete silos, the CEO balances competing priorities—including liquidity needs against growth aspirations and family preferences against institutional investment discipline. The CEO develops strategy, designs the organization's structure, manages hiring and personnel decisions, and serves as the family's primary interface with the broader advisory ecosystem. This role requires profound understanding of both family dynamics and financial management, as the CEO must translate family values into operational reality.[2][3]\n- oversees the investment function, a responsibility that varies substantially based on portfolio complexity, asset class concentration, and whether the family office manages assets in-house or through a hybrid model. The CIO develops and implements long-term investment strategy, executes that strategy through manager selection and asset allocation, and evaluates ongoing performance. In real estate-heavy portfolios, a specialized Head of Real Estate may complement or replace the CIO role. Beyond portfolio construction, the CIO manages liquidity across the entire family enterprise, understanding income sources, liabilities, and leverage profiles for each family member.

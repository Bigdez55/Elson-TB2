## CODE PATTERNS TO USE

### **Creating a Financial Planning Skill**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PlanningSkill(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def analyze(self, client_data: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Return analysis with metrics"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_recommendations(self, analysis: Dict) -> List[str]:
        """Return actionable recommendations"""
        pass

class YourNewSkill(PlanningSkill):
    def analyze(self, client_data: Dict) -> Dict:
        # Your logic here
        return {...}
    
    def generate_recommendations(self, analysis: Dict) -> List[str]:
        # Your recommendations
        return [...]
```

### **Creating an Advisor Persona**
```python
class YourNewAdvisor(Advisor):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            role=AdvisorRole.YOUR_ROLE,
            expertise_areas=[...]
        )
    
    def analyze_situation(self, client_data: Dict) -> Dict:
        # Specialist analysis
        pass
    
    def provide_recommendations(self, analysis: Dict) -> List[str]:
        # Specialist recommendations
        pass
    
    def coordinate_with_team(self, team: List[Advisor]) -> Dict:
        # How to work with others
        pass
```

### **Creating an API Endpoint**
```python
@app.post("/api/v1/clients/{client_id}/your-endpoint")
async def your_endpoint(client_id: str) -> Dict:
    """Your endpoint description"""
    client = await client_repo.get(client_id)
    result = await your_logic(client)
    return result
```
